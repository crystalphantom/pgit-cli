## A private git cli .

### Problem :
Tracking private or sensitive files in a Git repository without disrupting team workflows or requiring shared configuration changes. It enables developers to version control files like environment variables, private configurations, or personal tooling while keeping them completely isolated from the main team repository.

A key use case is managing AI-agent rules and filesâ€”such as those for Claude, Gemini, or claude-flow which should remain private and not committed to the
shared repo. Ensure zero impact on team members and full local control over private file management.
